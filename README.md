# Positivity and social media
Internet users often debate on why their preferred social media stands out from the rest. Objectively speaking, a good way of determining the best one is  through  the  procedure  of  sentiment  analysis. This process consists of measuring the degree of positivity of a given set of comments.

The main focus here is to be able to train a model on a Twitter data set, and predict the level of positivity for a set of data from Reddit. As a result, the best social media between these two will be decided.
